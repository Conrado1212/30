            <p class="desc">I received a jog offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned where current, if not more so, int the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
            <p class="cyt">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition  and have heard some people who had amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! Ienrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. SInce completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Soiftware Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

            <p class="desc-text">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
            <p class="cyt">"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. Ineeded some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. Iwas encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the porgram. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. the were very hands-on and I never had to wait long ffor assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutarail could ever have. In fact. I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
